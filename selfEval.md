# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I think that the syntax of how Objects need to be definied is a bit challengeing and found my self guessing what type of container symbols each part needed.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I take notes mostly when something took me a while to understand. I typically am copying a version of these problems to replit and using comments to put notes around them

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I definitely try to solve the problem myself first and make sure I give myself time to try a number of tactics before I google. I think this helps make the lesson stick for me over googling but I might google for a hint to point me in the right direction.
